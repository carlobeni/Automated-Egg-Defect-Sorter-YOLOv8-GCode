# 🤖 Automated Egg Defect Removal Robot

**Final Project – Robotics I, FIUNA – Mechatronics Engineering, 2025-1**  
**Authors: Lucas Pin, José Hellion, Matteo Martínez, Carlos Benítez**

This project presents a fully automated robotic system capable of detecting and removing defective eggs from a moving conveyor belt using computer vision and mechatronic control. The vision system is based on **YOLOv8**, a high-performance object detection model trained to identify damaged or abnormal eggs. Once detected, the defective eggs are precisely removed from the conveyor using a robotic actuator controlled via **GCODE 0.9** instructions.

The entire setup demonstrates an integrated solution combining real-time object detection, physical actuation, and communication between software and hardware components. The system aims to emulate real industrial quality control processes using low-cost hardware and open-source tools.
